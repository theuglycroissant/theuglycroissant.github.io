				<p>Add the flour, sugar and butter to a large mixing bowl. With your thumb and fingertips, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs.</p>
						
				<p>It is important here to only use the tips of your fingers and not the palms of your hands, the heat will melt the butter and the cooler the butter the shorter the pastry. Similarly, try not to overwork it, if it seems to be on the point of breadcrumbs, leave it. Small lumps of butter never hurt anyone.</p>
						
				<p>Add a tbsp of milk to the breadcrumbs and stir with a knife to bring them together. Gradually add 1tsp at a time until it resembles a soft, but not sticky, dough. Wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for 20 minutes (or as specified in the recipe).</p>
