				<p>Place the flour, sugar, baking powder and butter together in a large bowl. Using the tips of your fingers, rub the butter into the flour mix until it resembles breadcrumbs. Make a small well in the centre of the mix and pour in the milks. Mix with a spoon until combined.</p>
						
				<p>Bring the mixture together with your hands until a dough forms and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll until approximately 5mm thick and use a pastry cutter to make rounds, approximately 2in in diameter.</p>
						
				<p>Heat a frying pan or a griddle to a medium-high heat. Brush the pan with butter, and then place a few of the welsh cakes into the pan. Fry on each side for a couple of minutes until they turn a dark-golden colour. Cool on a cooling rack, and enjoy.</p>
